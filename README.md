# Clicker Rewrite

A rewrite of one of my first projects.

## Build Tools

- [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)

## Usage

First, create the folder on your computer where you want your project to be
stored.

Then, open a terminal at that directory and run the following commands:

```console
git clone https://github.com/swordofastrea/clicker-rewrite.git
npm i
rokit install
```

Make sure Roblox Studio is installed on Windows or macOS, and if you’re using Linux, Vinegar (preferably through Flatpak) so you can use rbxctl.
